# gallery

This was a project assigned to me in my Server Side Programming class at NMU. It consist of a login, which stores usernames and passwords in a mySQL database, and a home page in which you can upload pictures from another table in the same database. In addition, there is a gallery button, that once clicked it shows all the images saved in the database.

All the scripting is done in PHP.
