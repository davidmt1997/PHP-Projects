# map

This php script was an assignment given to me in my Server Side Programming class.

It creates a map from a group of latitudes and longitudes stored in a mySQL database. It uses some math formulas found online to position each of the coordinates on the screen and corectly form the map of the world. In addition, if its specfied in the url, for example: ?us (United States), it would only print the country corresponding to the 2 letter country code, also stored in the db.
